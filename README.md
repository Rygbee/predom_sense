This package contains scripts and python tools for learning predominant 
sense using HDP, a hierarchical topic model.

Directory Structure and Files
=============================
* ComputeSenseRanking.py: program that computes sense ranking and 
predominant sense.
* GenMacmillanSenses.py: program that generates Macmillan word 
distribution of senses.
* GenWordnetSenses.py: program that generates WordNet word distribution 
of senses.
* hdp_output: contains an example of the output generated by HDP.
* lemmatiser_tools: contains OpenNLP and Morpha for tokenising and 
 lemmatising the words when generating dictionary word distribution.
* predom_data: contains example input files for running the program.
* run_predom_sense.sh: script that drives the execution of the program.

Running the System
==================
Prerequisites:
-Wordnet
-HDP topic model (https://github.com/jhlau/hdp-wsi)
-Python lxml

1. Create lemmas.txt: a text file that contains the target lemmas of 
interest.
2. Run HDP to induce senses for the target lemmas.
3. If using Macmillan dictionary, create a directory that contains xml 
files of word definitions. If using WordNet, make sure it is installed 
(i.e.  "wn word -over" command needs to work).
3. Set up the parameters in run_predom_sense.sh and execute the script!


Input Format
============
* lemmas.txt: one line per lemma, in the format word.n (for nouns)
or word.v (for verbs). E.g. "bank.n"

Licensing
=========
